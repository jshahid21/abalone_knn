# Abalone Age Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors

This notebook demonstrates the process of building a K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict the age (number of rings) of abalone.

## Steps Taken:

1.  **Import Libraries**: Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, splitting, and modeling (`pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`).
2.  **Load Data**: Loaded the abalone dataset from '/content/abalone.data' into a pandas DataFrame, assigning appropriate column names.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**:
    *   Checked data types and found the 'Sex' column is of type 'object'.
    *   Checked for missing values and found none.
    *   Dropped the 'Sex' column as it is categorical and was not encoded for this specific model.
4.  **Define Features (X) and Target (y)**: Separated the features (all columns except 'Sex' and 'Rings') and the target variable ('Rings').
5.  **Split Data**: Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` with a test size of 20%.
6.  **Initialize and Train Model**: Initialized a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with `n_neighbors=3` and trained it on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`).
7.  **Evaluate Model**: Calculated the accuracy of the model on the training data.

## Interpretation of Results:

The training accuracy of the K-Nearest Neighbors model with `n_neighbors=3` is approximately 0.51. This indicates that the model correctly predicts the number of rings for about 51% of the training examples.

**Note:** This is a basic model and the accuracy can likely be improved by:

*   Handling the 'Sex' categorical variable through encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding).
*   Scaling the numerical features, as K-Nearest Neighbors is sensitive to the scale of the data.
*   Experimenting with different values of `n_neighbors`.
*   Evaluating the model on the test set (`X_test`, `y_test`) to get a more realistic estimate of its performance on unseen data.
*   Using other evaluation metrics relevant to regression or classification tasks (depending on how 'Rings' is treated).
